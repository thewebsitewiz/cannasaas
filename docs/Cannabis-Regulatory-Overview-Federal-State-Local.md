## 1. Federal Regulatory Landscape

Despite 40+ states legalizing medical cannabis and 24+ legalizing adult-use, cannabis remains federally regulated as a controlled substance. Every cannabis business must understand the tension between state legality and federal prohibition — it shapes taxation, banking, insurance, advertising, and interstate commerce.

### 1.1 Controlled Substances Act (CSA) — 21 U.S.C. §§ 801 et seq.

Cannabis (marijuana) is currently classified as a **Schedule I** controlled substance under the CSA. This means the federal government considers it to have a high potential for abuse and no currently accepted medical use. Manufacturing, distributing, dispensing, or possessing cannabis remains a federal crime — regardless of state law.

**Schedule III Rescheduling (In Progress):** On December 18, 2025, President Trump signed an executive order directing the Attorney General to reschedule marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III. The DOJ published a proposed rescheduling rule in May 2024 but has not yet finalized it. If completed, rescheduling would formally recognize cannabis's medical value and lower abuse potential, but it would **not** legalize state-regulated markets or resolve the federal-state conflict entirely. Rescheduling to Schedule III would still require cannabis to be dispensed via prescription under FDA oversight — a framework that doesn't align with how state markets currently operate.

**Key implications of Schedule I status that persist until rescheduling is finalized:**

- Federal criminal penalties remain in effect for manufacture, distribution, and possession.
- Cannabis businesses cannot claim most standard tax deductions (see Section 280E below).
- Traditional banking access is severely restricted.
- Interstate commerce of cannabis is prohibited — each state is a walled-off market.
- Federal employees and contractors face zero-tolerance policies.
- Cannabis businesses cannot obtain federal bankruptcy protection.
- Federal trademark registration is unavailable for cannabis products (though branding can be protected at the state level and for non-plant-touching services).

### 1.2 Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment (Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations)

Since 2014, this amendment has prohibited the DOJ from using federal funds to interfere with state **medical** cannabis programs. It has been renewed through temporary extensions; as of December 2025, it remains active but must be renegotiated in 2026. This protects medical operators only — it does **not** cover adult-use/recreational programs. The McClintock amendment, which would extend non-interference protections to adult-use programs, has never been included in a final enacted budget.

### 1.3 IRC Section 280E — Federal Tax Penalty

Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code prohibits businesses "trafficking in controlled substances" (Schedule I or II) from deducting ordinary and necessary business expenses. For cannabis businesses, this means no deductions for rent, payroll, marketing, utilities, professional fees, or any other standard operating expense.

The only exception: **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)** is still deductible. This includes direct costs like product acquisition from suppliers, freight, production labor, packaging materials, and lab testing. This structurally favors cultivators (who have high COGS) over retailers (whose COGS is limited to wholesale product cost).

**The result:** Effective tax rates for cannabis retailers routinely exceed 50-70%, compared to 21% for comparable non-cannabis businesses. Industry analysis suggests the typical dispensary pays approximately $268,000/year more in federal taxes than an equivalent non-cannabis retailer, with high-volume stores seeing the gap approach $800,000/year.

**If rescheduling to Schedule III is finalized**, 280E would no longer apply. Cannabis businesses could deduct ordinary expenses, dramatically improving profitability. The timing of when this relief applies — retroactively, upon the final rule, or only in the following tax year — remains uncertain and is a critical planning variable.

### 1.4 2018 Farm Bill / Hemp Distinction — 7 U.S.C. § 1639o

The 2018 Farm Bill legalized "hemp" — defined as cannabis with no more than 0.3% delta-9 THC by dry weight. This narrow definition inadvertently enabled a market for hemp-derived intoxicating cannabinoids (delta-8, delta-10, THCA, HHC, THCP) that were technically legal under federal law despite producing psychoactive effects.

**November 2025 Redefinition (H.R. 5371, Section 781):** Congress enacted legislation fundamentally changing the hemp definition, effective November 12, 2026:

- **New THC limit:** No more than 0.4 milligrams of total tetrahydrocannabinols per container (a dramatic shift from the old 0.3% by dry weight standard).
- **"Total THC" replaces "delta-9 only":** Closes the loophole for delta-8, THCA, and other analog cannabinoids.
- **Synthetic cannabinoid ban:** All cannabinoids must be naturally derived from the hemp plant — no chemical synthesis.
- **THC-analog prohibition:** Cannabinoids producing effects similar to THC are prohibited regardless of concentration.
- **Enforcement delayed one year** from enactment (enforcement begins November 12, 2026).

This effectively eliminates the majority of the current hemp-derived THC product market and is expected to impact an estimated 300,000 U.S. jobs in the hemp economy. Pending legislation (Hemp Planting Predictability Act, H.R. 7024) would delay the ban by three additional years to November 2028.

**CannaSaas Relevance:** Dispensaries selling hemp-derived products alongside regulated cannabis must monitor this closely. Product catalogs, compliance rules, and tax treatment will differ significantly for hemp vs. marijuana products after November 2026.

### 1.5 Federal Agencies with Cannabis Jurisdiction

| Agency | Role |
|---|---|
| **DEA** (Drug Enforcement Administration) | Enforces CSA, manages scheduling, issues research licenses |
| **FDA** (Food and Drug Administration) | Regulates drugs/food safety, oversees any future prescription cannabis pathway, monitors health claims |
| **IRS** (Internal Revenue Service) | Enforces Section 280E, collects federal taxes from cannabis businesses |
| **FinCEN** (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) | Issues guidance on cannabis banking, requires SARs (Suspicious Activity Reports) from banks serving cannabis clients |
| **TTB** (Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau) | Regulates cannabis-infused beverages if they contain alcohol |
| **USPS / DOT** | Prohibition on shipping/transporting cannabis across state lines |
| **OSHA** | Workplace safety applies to cannabis facilities like any employer |
| **EPA** | Environmental regulations on cultivation (water, pesticides, waste) |

### 1.6 Pending Federal Legislation (119th Congress, 2025-2026)

| Bill | Status | What It Would Do |
|---|---|---|
| **STATES 2.0 Act** | Introduced, no hearing | Remove federal penalties for state-legal cannabis, regulate interstate commerce |
| **PREPARE Act** (H.R. 2935) | Introduced, no hearing | Establish commission to advise on federal cannabis regulation modeled after alcohol |
| **MORE Act** (H.R. 5068) | Introduced, no hearing | Deschedule cannabis entirely, create federal regulatory framework, expunge records |
| **SAFER Banking Act** | Not yet reintroduced in 119th | Protect banks serving state-legal cannabis businesses from federal penalties |
| **Hemp Planting Predictability Act** (H.R. 7024) | Referred to Agriculture Committee | Delay 2025 hemp THC ban by three years to 2028 |

## 2. State Regulatory Frameworks

CannaSaas targets dispensaries in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. Each state has its own cannabis law, regulatory body, licensing structure, and operational rules. While they share common themes (21+ age requirement, seed-to-sale tracking, child-resistant packaging), the details differ significantly.

### 2.1 New York

**Governing Law:** Marijuana Regulation and Taxation Act (MRTA), signed March 31, 2021.

**Regulatory Body:** Office of Cannabis Management (OCM), overseen by the Cannabis Control Board (CCB). Website: cannabis.ny.gov

**Market Status (Feb 2026):** 545+ licensed adult-use dispensaries. Combined medical and adult-use market growing. Significant illicit market competition from unlicensed shops, which OCM enforcement efforts are actively targeting.

**License Types:**

- Adult-Use Retail Dispensary
- Adult-Use Cultivator, Processor, Distributor
- Medical Dispensing Facility (operated by Registered Organizations)
- Microbusiness
- Delivery Service
- On-Site Consumption (pending full rollout)
- Processor Type 3 (branding license, newly available)

**Key Operational Rules:**

- Adults 21+ may purchase up to 3 ounces of flower or 24 grams of concentrate per transaction.
- Home cultivation: up to 6 plants per person (3 mature, 3 immature), max 12 per household. Effective for medical patients now; adult-use home grow takes effect 18 months after first adult-use retail sale in the home county.
- No alcohol, tobacco, or non-cannabis food/beverage sales at dispensaries.
- All products must be tested by licensed independent laboratories.
- Social equity priority licensing for communities disproportionately impacted by cannabis prohibition.

**Seed-to-Sale Tracking:** New York transitioned from BioTrack to **Metrc** as the statewide cannabis tracking system. All licensees were required to complete Metrc credentialing by December 17, 2025, with retail dispensaries given until January 12, 2026, to enter existing inventory. Metrc is providing 20 million retail item UIDs at no cost to licensed processors through 2026.

**Key Deadline:** Retail Item UIDs required on all transfers by February 28, 2026.

### 2.2 New Jersey

**Governing Law:** Cannabis Regulatory, Enforcement Assistance, and Marketplace Modernization Act (CREAMMA), enacted February 22, 2021.

**Regulatory Body:** Cannabis Regulatory Commission (CRC). Website: nj.gov/cannabis

**Market Status (Feb 2026):** Robust adult-use market since April 2022. Consumption lounges began opening July 2025. Growing number of Class 5 retailers. Governor Murphy proposed increasing the Social Equity Excise Fee from $2.50 to $15/oz in the 2026 budget (500% increase).

**License Types (Classes):**

- Class 1: Cannabis Cultivator
- Class 2: Cannabis Manufacturer
- Class 3: Cannabis Wholesaler
- Class 4: Cannabis Distributor
- Class 5: Cannabis Retailer
- Class 6: Cannabis Delivery Service
- Microbusiness (limited scale, simplified licensing)
- Alternative Treatment Center (ATC) — medical legacy operators
- Expanded ATC — medical operators authorized for adult-use

**Key Operational Rules:**

- Adults 21+ may purchase up to 1 ounce of usable cannabis per transaction.
- Medical patients may purchase up to 3 ounces per 30-day period.
- Home cultivation is **not** permitted (neither medical nor adult-use).
- Dispensaries may not sell food, beverages, alcohol, or tobacco.
- All cannabis businesses must develop, implement, and maintain an operation manual.
- Consumption lounges permitted only at Class 5 dispensaries with municipal approval and CRC endorsement.
- Delivery permitted via licensed personnel or Class 6 delivery service.
- **Intoxicating Hemp Products:** Governor Murphy signed P.L. 2025, c.215 on January 12, 2026, regulating production and sale of intoxicating hemp-derived products under CRC oversight.

**Seed-to-Sale Tracking:** New Jersey uses **Metrc** for all tracking and compliance reporting. All businesses must maintain active Metrc accounts and tag every cannabis item with unique stamps/tags.

**Municipal Control:** Municipalities independently determine whether to allow cannabis businesses and set their own zoning ordinances. The CRC will not issue a license that violates a local ordinance.

### 2.3 Connecticut

**Governing Law:** SB 1201 (Public Act 21-1, June Special Session), signed June 22, 2021.

**Regulatory Body:** Department of Consumer Protection (DCP). Website: portal.ct.gov/cannabis

**Market Status (Feb 2026):** Adult-use sales began January 2023. Market growing with combination of converted medical dispensaries (hybrid retailers) and new adult-use-only licensees. Infused beverages permitted as of April 2025.

**License Types:**

- Cultivator / Micro-cultivator
- Producer (medical cannabis cultivation)
- Product Manufacturer / Food & Beverage Manufacturer
- Dispensary Facility (medical only)
- Retailer (adult-use)
- Hybrid Retailer (medical + adult-use)
- Delivery Service
- Transporter

**Key Operational Rules:**

- Adults 21+ may purchase up to 1.5 ounces of flower or equivalent per transaction.
- Medical patients: up to 5 ounces per 30-day period.
- Home cultivation legal for adults 21+ (up to 3 mature and 3 immature plants per person, max 12 per household).
- Infused beverages (non-alcoholic, up to 3 mg THC per 12-oz container, max 4 per package) may be sold by licensed dispensaries, retailers, and package stores with permits.
- **Moderate-THC hemp products** (0.5-5 mg total THC per container): Only cannabis establishments or businesses with a DCP certificate of registration may sell these as of January 1, 2025. Registration fee: $1,000-$2,000.
- Public Act 25-166 further refined product potency rules, business operating requirements, and hemp/tobacco/cannabis regulatory alignment.

**Seed-to-Sale Tracking:** Connecticut currently uses **BioTrack** (Cannabis Analytic Tracking System / CATS). Given the BioTrack/Metrc merger (August 2025), a transition to Metrc is anticipated but no official timeline has been announced.

**Social Equity:** Connecticut's Social Equity Council oversees equity applicant support, and dispensaries seeking hybrid-retail licenses must have workforce development plans approved.

## 3. Local / Municipal Regulations

Cannabis regulation operates on three tiers: federal, state, and local. In all three CannaSaas target states, municipalities hold significant gatekeeping power.

### 3.1 Opt-In / Opt-Out Authority

All three states (NY, NJ, CT) allow municipalities to opt out of permitting cannabis businesses within their borders:

- **New York:** Municipalities had until December 31, 2021, to opt out of adult-use retail dispensaries and/or on-site consumption. Those that opted out can opt back in. Those that did not opt out cannot subsequently ban cannabis businesses.
- **New Jersey:** Municipalities can pass ordinances prohibiting or restricting cannabis businesses by type, number, and location. No statewide deadline — local governments can act at any time.
- **Connecticut:** Municipalities may pass ordinances prohibiting cannabis establishments and regulating location, number, and operating hours.

### 3.2 Zoning & Land Use

Local zoning boards control where dispensaries can physically operate. Common zoning restrictions include:

- **Buffer zones** — minimum distances from schools, daycare centers, churches, parks, playgrounds, libraries, and other dispensaries (typically 200-1,000 feet, varies by municipality).
- **Zoning district restrictions** — cannabis businesses often limited to commercial, industrial, or specifically designated districts.
- **Signage and exterior requirements** — municipalities may impose additional restrictions beyond state law on storefront appearance, signage size, lighting, and window displays.
- **Parking and traffic** — some municipalities impose minimum parking requirements or require traffic studies.
- **Hours of operation** — local ordinances may restrict operating hours beyond state minimums.

### 3.3 Local Taxes and Fees

- **New York:** Municipalities may impose a local cannabis retail tax of up to 4% (split: 1% county, 3% town/city or village).
- **New Jersey:** Municipalities can levy local transfer taxes of up to 2% on retail sales, plus additional fees on other license classes.
- **Connecticut:** Municipalities receive a portion of the state cannabis tax revenue; specific local tax authority varies.

### 3.4 Community Impact Requirements

Many municipalities require cannabis businesses to:

- Submit community impact plans as part of the application process.
- Conduct community outreach or hold public hearings before opening.
- Demonstrate plans for odor mitigation, noise reduction, and neighborhood compatibility.
- Participate in local social equity or community benefit initiatives.

**Product potency limits vary by state.** For example, many states cap edible THC at 5-10 mg per serving and 50-100 mg per package. Check current state regulations for specifics.

### 5.4 Prohibited Products

All three states prohibit products that:

- Are designed to appeal to minors (cartoon characters, candy-brand imitation, animal shapes, bright colors targeting children)
- Make unapproved health or therapeutic claims
- Contain alcohol above de minimis levels (state-specific thresholds)
- Contain additives prohibited by the state (e.g., certain thinning agents for vape products, vitamin E acetate)
- Are not lab-tested and certified by a state-licensed laboratory

### 5.5 Distribution & Transport

- Cannabis may only be transported within state lines by licensed entities.
- All transport must use secured, GPS-tracked vehicles.

- **Connecticut:** Delivery service licenses available; co-delivery of cannabis with hemp products and infused beverages is permitted.

All states require ID verification at point of delivery, sealed product packaging, GPS tracking, and transaction limits.

---

## 6. Packaging & Labeling Requirements

Packaging and labeling are among the most heavily regulated areas. Non-compliance can result in fines up to $5,000 per violation (CT), product seizure, and license suspension.

### 6.1 Packaging Requirements (All Three States)

- **Child-resistant:** Must meet Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) standards — difficult for children under 5 to open, not difficult for adults to use.
- **Tamper-evident:** Consumer can tell if package has been opened or altered.
- **Opaque:** Contents must not be visible from outside the package.
- **Resealable** (NJ requirement, best practice in all states for multi-dose products).
- **No appeals to minors:** No cartoons, toy-like shapes, candy-brand imitations, images likely to attract children.
- **Biodegradable effort:** NJ requires businesses to make a good faith effort to use biodegradable packaging.

### 6.2 Labeling Requirements (Common Across States)

Required label information:

- Product name and type (flower, edible, concentrate, etc.)
- Net weight or volume
- **Cannabinoid profile:** Total THC, total CBD (and other cannabinoids as required), expressed in milligrams per serving and per package
- Serving size and number of servings
- Manufacturer/processor name and license number
- Batch/lot number for traceability
- Date of manufacture
- Expiration date or "use by" date
- Lab testing results or certificate of analysis reference
- **Universal warning symbol** (state-specific design, required prominently on each product)
- **Warning statements** (exact language varies by state):
  - "This product contains cannabis"
  - "For use only by adults 21 years of age and older"
  - "Keep out of reach of children"
  - "May cause impairment — do not drive or operate machinery"
  - "There may be health risks associated with consumption of this product"
  - CT requires: "Cannabis use during pregnancy can result in low-weight births and other problems for your baby"
- Ingredient list (for manufactured/processed products)
- Allergen information where applicable
- **No false or misleading statements**
- **No unapproved health or therapeutic claims** — products are not FDA-approved drugs

### 6.3 State-Specific Labeling Notes

**New York:** OCM published updated Packaging, Labeling, Marketing & Advertising (PLMA) regulations effective December 2025. Retail packaging standards, exit packaging, display panel information, and updated warning statements take effect 6 months after publication. QR codes linking to product and lab test information are part of the Metrc seed-to-sale rollout.

**New Jersey:** Packaging and labeling rules in N.J.A.C. 17:30-16.2 through 17:30-16.6. All cannabis items must contain a unique Metrc stamp or tag. For edibles, each single serving must be demarcated (individually wrapped or physically separated). Expiration dates determined by stability testing; maximum expiration dates vary by product type and storage conditions.

**Connecticut:** DCP sets packaging and labeling requirements with distinct rules for medical versus adult-use products. Lozenges are classified as edible products unless in child-resistant packaging. Medical product labeling can only reference use for debilitating medical conditions.

## 7. Advertising & Marketing Regulations

Cannabis advertising is among the most restricted areas of cannabis law. Every advertisement, marketing piece, social media post, and public communication must comply with both state regulations and federal constraints (since cannabis remains federally illegal, FTC and FCC rules create additional limitations).

### 7.1 Universal Prohibitions (All Three States)

Across NY, NJ, and CT, cannabis advertising **may not**:

- Target, appeal to, or be designed to be attractive to persons under 21
- Use cartoon characters, mascots, toy imagery, or candy-brand imitations
- Make false, deceptive, or misleading claims
- Make health, therapeutic, or curative claims (unless specifically authorized for medical products, and even then only for qualifying conditions)
- Promote overconsumption
- Depict consumption of cannabis
- Be placed within a specified distance of schools, playgrounds, or other youth-focused facilities
- Advertise on broadcast television or radio where the audience is reasonably expected to include more than a specified percentage of minors (typically 15-30% threshold)

### 7.2 New York Advertising Rules

**Regulatory Framework:** Part 129 of the Cannabis Law (recently amended November 2025, published December 2025).

**Key Rules:**

- **Billboard advertising is prohibited.** Licensees using billboards or prohibited signage must remove them by February 24, 2026.
- Outdoor signage: Unlimited signage permitted on retail shops; up to 3 signs when not affixed to the retail store.
- **Sales and discounts now permitted** (as of 2026 amendment) — price reductions, bundles, and coupons allowed. Sale prices cannot be below market value and cannot be structured to evade tax collection.
- **Loyalty programs now authorized** — points-based reward systems and customer loyalty programs permitted.
- Free or donated cannabis products remain prohibited.
- Only licensees in Connecticut may advertise cannabis or cannabis-related services.
- All advertising must include a health warning statement and age restriction notice.
- Third-party marketing platforms (like Leafly, Weedmaps) are subject to specific rules — a federal judge struck down some of OCM's harsher third-party marketing restrictions in the *Leafly Holdings v. NYS OCM* case.
- Digital advertising/websites must include age verification (21+).
- Contact information may be advertised but cannabis imagery and product depictions are restricted.

**Advertising that IS permitted in NY:**

- In-store signage and point-of-sale displays
- Website and email marketing (with age gates)
- Social media presence (brand awareness, no direct product promotion violating platform policies)
- Print advertising in publications with predominantly adult audiences
- Sponsorship of events (with restrictions)
- SEO and organic digital marketing

### 7.3 New Jersey Advertising Rules

**Regulatory Framework:** N.J.A.C. 17:30 (CRC Personal Use Cannabis Rules), CREAMMA Act provisions.

**Key Rules:**

- No targeting minors in any medium (TV, radio, billboards, print, internet, mobile, social media, email)
- No false or misleading health information
- No promotion of overconsumption
- Social media platforms may only be used for brand awareness — explicit cannabis ads are restricted
- Google Ads, most paid social media, and traditional billboard advertising are effectively off-limits
- All website content must comply with CRC guidelines, including age verification and legal disclaimers
- Compliance with Connecticut's Unfair Trade Practice Acts (CUTPA equivalent: NJ Consumer Fraud Act)

**Effective Marketing Channels in NJ:**

- Compliant digital platforms (cannabis-specific directories)
- Educational and informational events
- In-store signage
- Direct communication via email and/or SMS (with opt-in consent)
- SEO and Google Business Profile optimization
- Community partnerships (wellness fairs, educational events)

### 7.4 Connecticut Advertising Rules

**Regulatory Framework:** P.A. 21-1 (Section 33), P.A. 22-103 (Section 8), DCP policies and procedures.

**Key Rules:**

- Only cannabis establishments licensed in Connecticut may advertise cannabis or cannabis-related services in the state.
- Businesses or individuals that certify medical marijuana patients **cannot** advertise cannabis-related services (they are not licensed cannabis establishments).
- All restrictions apply across all media: TV, radio, billboards, outdoor signage, print, internet, mobile apps, social media, electronic communications.
- **Warning statement required in all ads:** "Cannabis and cannabis products have intoxicating effects and may be habit forming. Cannabis and cannabis products can impair concentration, coordination, and judgment. Do not operate a vehicle or machinery under the influence of cannabis and cannabis products. There may be health risks associated with consumption of cannabis and cannabis products. For use only by adults twenty-one years of age or older. It is illegal to use cannabis if you are under twenty-one years of age. Keep cannabis out of the reach of children."
- For print/visual media: warning must be conspicuous, easily legible, and take up at least **10% of the advertisement space**.
- For audio media: warning must be at the same speed as the rest of the advertisement and easily intelligible.
- Medical marijuana advertising may only encourage use for debilitating medical conditions (no other purposes).
- Advertising restrictions prohibit kid-friendly graphics, unsubstantiated health claims, or imagery likely to appeal to minors.
- Violations are considered Unfair Trade Practices under CUTPA, with civil penalties.
- DCP fines for advertising violations: up to $5,000 per violation plus potential license suspension or revocation.

### 7.5 Digital & Social Media Considerations

Cannabis businesses face unique digital marketing challenges because major platforms restrict cannabis advertising:

| Platform | Policy |
|---|---|
| **Google Ads** | No cannabis product ads; some allowances for CBD/topical hemp products in certain states |
| **Meta (Facebook/Instagram)** | No promotion of sale/use of cannabis; some CBD/topical ads allowed |
| **X (Twitter)** | Allows cannabis brand advertising in legal states (restricted targeting) |
| **TikTok** | Prohibits cannabis content |
| **Snapchat** | No cannabis advertising |
| **LinkedIn** | No cannabis product advertising |
| **Cannabis-specific platforms** (Leafly, Weedmaps, Dutchie) | Cannabis advertising permitted; state-specific compliance required |

**Best practice:** Focus on owned media (website, email, SMS), SEO, Google Business Profile, educational content marketing, and community engagement.

## 8. Seed-to-Sale Tracking & Compliance Reporting

### 8.1 What Is Seed-to-Sale Tracking?

Every state requires licensed cannabis businesses to track every cannabis product from cultivation through processing, testing, distribution, and retail sale using a state-mandated electronic tracking system. This creates a chain-of-custody audit trail for compliance, tax collection, and consumer safety.

### 8.2 Tracking Systems by State

| State | System | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **New York** | **Metrc** | Live (transitioned from BioTrack, Dec 2025) |
| **New Jersey** | **Metrc** | Active |
| **Connecticut** | **BioTrack** (CATS) | Active; Metrc transition anticipated post-merger |

### 8.3 Metrc Compliance Requirements (NY & NJ)

Metrc (Marijuana Enforcement Tracking Reporting Compliance) is the predominant system. All licensed businesses must:

- Maintain active Metrc credentials and accounts
- Tag every cannabis item with unique identifiers (UIDs)
- Report all "inventory events": receiving transfers, creating packages, adjusting inventory, completing sales, destroying waste
- Report sales receipts within 24 hours of each transaction (critical compliance requirement)
- Reconcile inventory against Metrc records regularly
- Respond to discrepancies flagged by the regulator
- Maintain records accessible for state audits

### 8.4 Reporting Obligations

| Report | Frequency | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Sales receipts | Within 24 hours of sale | Every retail transaction reported to state tracking system |
| Inventory reconciliation | Daily/weekly (varies) | Physical inventory matched against system records |
| Transfer manifests | Per transfer | Documented chain of custody for product movement |
| Waste/destruction | Per event | Cannabis waste documented and reported |
| Adverse events | Immediately upon discovery | Product quality/safety issues reported to state |
| Annual reports | Annually | Business operations summary, compliance status |

---

## 9. Taxation

### 9.1 Federal Taxes

- **IRC Section 280E** (until rescheduling is finalized): Only COGS deductible; all other business expenses non-deductible. Effective tax rates 50-70%+.
- Standard federal income tax applies (corporate rate 21%; pass-through rates vary).
- Self-employment tax for sole proprietors/partners.
- Cannabis businesses must file federal returns and pay federal taxes regardless of state legality.

### 9.2 State Taxes

| | New York | New Jersey | Connecticut |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Excise Tax** | Potency-based: varies by mg THC per product type | Social Equity Excise Fee (currently $2.50/oz on cultivators; proposed increase to $15/oz) | State excise tax on adult-use sales |
| **State Sales Tax** | State sales tax applies | 6.625% state sales tax on adult-use (medical exempt) | 6.35% state sales tax |
| **Local Tax** | Up to 4% municipal tax (1% county + 3% city/village) | Up to 2% municipal transfer tax | Revenue sharing with municipalities |
| **Medical Tax** | Reduced/exempt | Exempt from NJ sales tax | Exempt |

### 9.3 Tax Compliance Best Practices

- Maintain meticulous records of COGS for 280E optimization.
- Separate cannabis and non-cannabis business activities where possible (some businesses operate ancillary non-cannabis lines to claim standard deductions on those operations).
- Consult cannabis-specialized CPA for 280E strategy.
- Plan for potential 280E elimination — model both scenarios.
- Track and remit all state/local taxes accurately and on time.
- Cannabis businesses are higher audit targets — maintain audit-ready records at all times.

## 10. Banking, Finance & Payments

### 10.1 The Banking Problem

Because cannabis remains federally illegal (Schedule I), banks and credit unions face potential federal money laundering charges (under the Bank Secrecy Act) for serving cannabis businesses. While FinCEN issued 2014 guidance creating a pathway for banks to serve cannabis clients, compliance is burdensome and most major banks decline.

**The result:**

- Many cannabis businesses operate primarily in cash, creating security risks.
- Banks that do serve cannabis charge premium fees ($2,000-$10,000/month for basic accounts).
- Traditional credit card processing (Visa, Mastercard, Amex) is generally unavailable for plant-touching businesses.
- Business loans and lines of credit from traditional lenders are extremely limited.
- Cannabis businesses cannot access federal bankruptcy protection.

### 10.2 FinCEN Requirements

Banks choosing to serve cannabis businesses must:

- File initial Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) — "Marijuana Limited" SARs for compliant businesses, "Marijuana Priority" SARs for higher-risk clients, "Marijuana Termination" SARs when closing accounts
- Conduct enhanced due diligence on all cannabis clients
- Monitor for signs of federal law violations (interstate transport, sales to minors, proceeds flowing to criminal enterprises, etc.)
- Verify clients hold valid state licenses

### 10.3 Payment Alternatives

Cannabis businesses commonly use:

- **Cash:** Still dominant in many markets; requires robust cash handling and security protocols.
- **Debit/PIN-based transactions:** Some payment processors offer compliant debit solutions (Aeropay, CanPay, Paytender).
- **ACH/bank transfers:** For B2B transactions between licensees.
- **Cashless ATMs (POB/Point-of-Banking):** Technically compliant in some configurations but under increased scrutiny. Visa and Mastercard have signaled enforcement against misclassified transactions.
- **Cannabis-specific payment platforms:** Emerging solutions designed for compliant cashless transactions.

### 10.4 Schedule III Implications for Banking

Rescheduling to Schedule III would reduce perceived risk for financial institutions but would **not** automatically guarantee banking access. The SAFER Banking Act (or similar legislation) is still needed to explicitly protect banks from federal prosecution. However, rescheduling is expected to encourage more banks to enter the cannabis space, gradually improving financial services availability.

## 11. Employment & Workforce Compliance

### 11.1 Employee Credentialing

All three states require cannabis business employees to obtain state-issued credentials:

- **Background checks** on all employees (disqualifying convictions vary by state — note that a conviction is not necessarily disqualifying in NJ)
- **Employee ID cards** issued by the regulatory body
- **Training requirements:** State-approved training courses covering cannabis history, relevant laws, product knowledge, health education, and responsible service
- Employee credentials typically valid for one year, requiring annual renewal

### 11.2 Workforce Development

- **New York:** Social equity plans require workforce development initiatives targeting communities affected by cannabis prohibition.
- **New Jersey:** Labor peace agreement required with bona fide labor organization. Workforce development plans, including diversity plans, required in license applications.
- **Connecticut:** Hybrid-retail licensees must have workforce development plans approved by the Social Equity Council.

### 11.3 Employment Law Considerations

- Federal workplace drug testing policies may still apply (especially for federally regulated industries).
- State anti-discrimination protections for cannabis use vary:
  - **NY:** Employers generally cannot discriminate based on off-duty cannabis use (Labor Law § 201-d).
  - **NJ:** CREAMMA provides some employment protections; employers may still enforce workplace impairment policies.
  - **CT:** Employment protections for medical cannabis patients; recreational protections more limited.
- OSHA requirements apply to cannabis facilities (workplace safety, ventilation, chemical handling).
- Workers' compensation implications for cannabis-industry employees.

---

## 12. Security & Facility Requirements

### 12.1 Physical Security

All three states require cannabis businesses to maintain robust physical security:

- **Surveillance systems:** 24/7 video recording covering all areas where cannabis is stored, handled, or sold. Footage retained for minimum 90 days (varies by state). Camera resolution must be sufficient to identify individuals.
- **Alarm systems:** Intrusion detection systems connected to a central monitoring station.
- **Access control:** Restricted access areas for cannabis storage, processing, and inventory. Badge/key card access for employees only.
- **Safes/vaults:** Secured storage for cannabis inventory and cash.
- **Visitor logs:** All non-employee visitors tracked and escorted.
- **Perimeter security:** Adequate lighting, fencing where applicable, controlled entry points.
- **Panic buttons / duress alarms** in areas handling cash or high-value products.

### 12.2 Facility Requirements

- Odor mitigation / air purification systems (required in all three states)
- Noise reduction measures
- Separate areas for different operations (retail floor, inventory storage, employee-only areas)
- ADA compliance for customer-facing areas
- Fire code compliance
- Local building code and health department approvals

## 13. Testing & Quality Assurance

### 13.1 Mandatory Testing

All cannabis products sold in regulated markets must be tested by independent, state-licensed laboratories. Required testing panels typically include:

| Test Category | What's Tested |
|---|---|
| **Potency** | THC, CBD, THCA, CBDA, and other cannabinoid concentrations |
| **Pesticides** | Residual pesticide screening (comprehensive panel of prohibited chemicals) |
| **Heavy metals** | Lead, arsenic, cadmium, mercury |
| **Microbial contaminants** | Salmonella, E. coli, Aspergillus, total yeast and mold |
| **Mycotoxins** | Aflatoxins, ochratoxin A |
| **Residual solvents** | Butane, propane, ethanol, and other extraction solvents (for concentrates/extracts) |
| **Moisture content** | Water activity levels (to prevent mold growth) |
| **Foreign matter** | Hair, insects, soil, glass, and other physical contaminants |
| **Terpene profile** | Optional but increasingly standard for product differentiation |
| **Homogeneity** | For edibles — consistent dosing across servings within a package |

### 13.2 Recall Procedures

All cannabis businesses must have documented recall procedures including:

- Ability to trace any product to its source batch via seed-to-sale tracking
- Communication protocols for notifying regulators, distributors, and consumers
- Physical product retrieval procedures
- Quarantine and destruction of recalled products
- Root cause analysis and corrective action documentation

## 14. Best Business Practices

Beyond legal compliance, the following best practices distinguish successful, sustainable cannabis businesses.

### 14.1 Compliance Culture

- Designate a Chief Compliance Officer or compliance point-person responsible for monitoring regulatory changes, managing audits, and maintaining all compliance documentation.
- Subscribe to regulatory updates from OCM (NY), CRC (NJ), and DCP (CT) — regulations change frequently.
- Build compliance into daily operations, not as an afterthought. Integrate compliance checks into POS workflows, inventory management, and employee procedures.
- Maintain audit-ready records at all times — assume an inspection can happen any day.
- Document everything: training records, SOPs, incident reports, maintenance logs, visitor logs, waste disposal records.

### 14.2 Inventory & Financial Controls

- Conduct daily inventory counts (at minimum weekly physical counts reconciled against seed-to-sale system).
- Implement dual-control procedures for cash handling (two-person counts, armored car pickups).
- Separate cannabis inventory tracking from general accounting — but ensure they reconcile.
- Use cannabis-specific POS systems that integrate with Metrc/BioTrack for automatic compliance reporting.
- Maintain detailed COGS records for 280E optimization (work with a cannabis-specialized CPA).
- Build a reserve for tax obligations — 280E makes quarterly estimated payments significantly higher than comparable businesses expect.

### 14.3 Customer Experience & Responsible Service

- Train all customer-facing staff on product knowledge, dosing guidance, and responsible consumption.
- Never make medical claims unless authorized (and even then, only for qualifying conditions in medical programs).
- Implement robust age verification — check every ID, every time.
- Offer diverse product options at multiple price points to compete with the illicit market.
- Build a compliant loyalty/rewards program (now permitted in NY; check NJ and CT rules).
- Invest in educational content — customers who understand products become repeat customers.

### 14.4 Data & Privacy

- Cannabis businesses collect sensitive personal information (medical records, purchase history, ID data).
- Implement privacy policies compliant with state consumer privacy laws.
- Encrypt customer data at rest and in transit.
- Metrc user API keys and dispensary credentials must be encrypted and access-controlled.
- Connecticut requires strict disclosure rules preventing disclosure of individually identifying information (with limited exceptions).
- Never share customer purchase data with third parties without explicit consent.

### 14.5 Insurance

- Cannabis-specific insurance is essential (general business insurance policies typically exclude cannabis activities).
- Key coverage types: general liability, product liability, property, crop/inventory, professional liability, workers' compensation, cyber liability, directors & officers.
- Work with cannabis-industry specialty brokers who understand the regulatory landscape.
- Coverage availability and cost should improve as Schedule III rescheduling proceeds.

### 14.6 Community Relations

- Engage proactively with neighbors and local community before and after opening.
- Participate in local business associations and community events.
- Support social equity initiatives and community reinvestment programs.
- Address complaints promptly and transparently.
- Maintain a clean, professional, and welcoming storefront that reflects positively on the industry.

### 14.7 Technology & Automation

- Invest in integrated technology platforms that connect POS, seed-to-sale compliance (Metrc/BioTrack), inventory management, and e-commerce.
- Automate compliance reporting where possible (automatic sale reporting to Metrc within 24 hours, nightly inventory reconciliation, flagging discrepancies).
- Implement online ordering and menu management to drive traffic and compete with the illicit market.
- Use cannabis-specific platforms designed for regulatory compliance — general retail software often cannot handle the unique compliance requirements.
